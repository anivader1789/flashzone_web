<h2>Quiet your mind, open your heart</h2> 
<p>Join Suey every 1st and 3rd Monday of the month and connect with your inner self in divine conscious community as collectively, we embark on a journey of self-discovery and collective healing.</p> 
<p>In this drop-in community healing circle, we explore various meditation styles and techniques, allowing each participant to find what resonates most deeply with them. From mindfulness to guided visualization, from breathwork to mantra meditation, movement to complete silence, we embrace the rich tapestry of practices that help us cultivate inner peace and harmony.</p> 
<p>At the heart of our circle lies the intention to not only nurture our own well-being but also to extend healing energy outwards to our community and the world. We come together to consciously channel our collective intention and send healing vibrations to those in need, fostering compassion and unity across boundaries.  \nWhether you're a seasoned meditator or just beginning your journey, you are warmly invited to join us in this sacred space of self-exploration and global healing. Together, let's cultivate a sense of peace, connection, and resilience that ripples outwards, creating positive change in ourselves and the world around us.</p>
