    <h1 style="color: #333333;">Welcome and getting started on FlashZone</h1>

    <p>Welcome! We're excited to have you join our community. This short guide will help you get set up and start using FlashZone right away.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #007bff;">
        <b>Note:</b> If you ever get stuck, remember you can always visit our Help Center or contact our support team.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #555555; margin-top: 30px;">Local Website</h2>
    <p>This website is local. Users in other locations don't see what you're seeing. This is because our purpose is to build local communities made up of people who share one or more interests. When you change your location you will see the content in the new location, both posts and events. For this version "local" means 30 miles. We are focusing on this NY/CT (parts of, and a touch of NJ) locality first (everyone has to start somewhere). We chose that because it was a maximum distance that many people would drive to to get to an event they would really like to participate in. You will see the distance from your location to events that are listed.</p>

    <h2 style="color: #555555; margin-top: 30px;">We Use Flashtags</h2>
    <p>When you post please tap the hashtag and place it in front of key words in your post. Doing so will change those words into links. They will appear as a geo-anchored hashtag symbol when your post is published. This symbol is called a flashtag: &nbsp; It geo-anchors the words that come immediately after it. As we introduce new features these flashtags will arrange your posts so that people with similar interests locally can find them all in one place. Clicking on a flashtag will show you all the other flashes (posts) which include the same flashtag.</p>

    <p>Feel free to place flashtags in front of multiple keywords in your post. For, example, this post: </p>
    <p style="font-family: monospace; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 15px; border: 1px dashed #cccccc; white-space: pre-wrap;">"I had an amazing #Reiki session. My Reiki practitioner used #MusicalTones and it amplified the experience. Thank you @angelD if you're reading this."</p>

    <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">

    <h2 style="color: #555555;">Other features:</h2>
    <p><b>Fams:</b> a free membership group you join (or create). A fam includes a private chat room for members. Please keep it wholesome.</p>
    <p><b>Local events</b></p>
    <p><b>Coming:</b> Direct messaging</p>
    <p><b>Coming:</b> Users able to follow events that interest them and get notifications when the event date approaches. (A solution to the problem of forgetting events we really wanted to get to!)</p>
    <p><b>Coming:</b> Users able to call in-person meet-up style meetings at no cost. (I’m personally really excited at the prospect of this.)</p>

    <hr style="margin: 40px 0;">
